## Star Wars Database React App


You need to install dependencies:

### `npm install`

<br>

##In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from project.
